# Driving Tracker
Using the mathematical computing software program MathWorks, I was able to code and construct a program that can record the driving behaviors of a user and report the data to the user through graphical figures and maps.

Using the Matlab Mobile app’s sensor feature, I was able to track my iPhone’s movement by turning on the position sensor which tracked the needed geographic position and speed in meters per second. The position data was given a corresponding timestamp every tenth of a second. The drive was then saved to the Matlab Mobile app online cloud in the form of a Matlab file (ex: data.mat). Once uploaded to the cloud, the file was then downloaded to my PC in order to access it for the driving program I had created.

The code was then created in the MATLAB desktop application. The program I coded could then load the data from the MatLab file, create the needed variables, and then create the figures for the data tracked to become visible, tangible information for anyone to use.

Text file used for the program: rush+hour.mat
